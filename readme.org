#+DESCRIPTION: Command-line tool for spinning up an OCaml/Opam/Dune project
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil, num:nil

* Description

=spinup= is a command-line tool that generates starter boilerplate for
an OCaml project.

* Features

=spinup= is:

- intended to work with the least possible amount of configuration
- opinionated about what goes in an OCaml project
- bases its opinions about what goes in an OCaml project on what goes
  in the author's OCaml projects

For example:

- =spinup= assumes library-executable design
- =spinup= assumes =dune= as a build tool
- =spinup= assumes =opam= as a package manager
- =spinup= assumes [[https://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/software/prelude/prelude/Prelude/][Prelude]] (with [[https://github.com/bufordrat/etude][Etude]]) as a standard library
- =spinup= assumes =alcotest= as a unit-testing framework
- =spinup= creates boilerplate for running cram tests with =dune=
- =spinup= uses [[https://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/software/tint/lib/top/][TINT]] as a template engine
