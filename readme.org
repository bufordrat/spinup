#+DESCRIPTION: Command-line tool for spinning up an OCaml/Opam/Dune project
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil, num:nil

* Description

=spinup= is a command-line tool that generates starter boilerplate for
an OCaml project.

* Features

=spinup= is intended to work with the least possible amount of
configuration and is thus opinionated about what goes in an OCaml
project.

For example:

- =spinup= assumes library-executable design
- =spinup= assumes =dune= as a build tool
- =spinup= assumes =opam= as a package manager
- =spinup= assumes [[https://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/software/prelude/prelude/Prelude/][Prelude]] (with [[https://github.com/bufordrat/etude][Etude]]) as a standard library
- =spinup= assumes =alcotest= as a unit-testing framework
- =spinup= creates boilerplate for running cram tests with =dune=
- =spinup= uses [[https://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/software/tint/lib/top/][TINT]] as a template engine

* Install

First, install =opam= through your OS's package manager, e.g. on Arch
Linux:

#+begin_example
  $ sudo pacman -S opam
#+end_example

Or on macOS:

#+begin_example
  $ brew install opam
#+end_example

Then install =spinup= using =opam=:

#+begin_example
  $ opam repository add dldc https://dldc.lib.uchicago.edu/opam
  $ opam install spinup
#+end_example

* Run

#+begin_example
  $ spinup name_of_your_project
#+end_example
