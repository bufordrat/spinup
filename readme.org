#+TITLE: spinup
#+AUTHOR: Matt Teichman
#+DESCRIPTION: Command-line tool for spinning up an OCaml/Opam/Dune project
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil, num:nil

=spinup= is a command-line tool that generates starter boilerplate for
an OCaml project.  It is:

- intended to work with the least possible amount of configuration
- opinionated about what goes in an OCaml project
- configurable mainly via changes to its templates

* Features

- simple syntax
- config file in GNU Refer format
- all default configuration packed directly into the binary using
  =ocaml-crunch=
- customizable templates which use [[https://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/software/tint/lib/top/][TINT]] as a template engine

* Quickstart

First, install =opam= through your OS's package manager.

** Install

Arch Linux:

#+begin_example
  $ sudo pacman -S opam
#+end_example

macOS:

#+begin_example
  $ brew install opam
#+end_example

Once =opam= is installed, install =spinup=:

#+begin_example
  $ opam repository add dldc https://dldc.lib.uchicago.edu/opam
  $ opam install spinup
#+end_example

** Run

#+begin_example
  $ spinup your_project
#+end_example

** Enjoy

#+begin_example
  $ eval $(opam env)
  $ cd /path/to/your_project
  $ dune exec your_project
  $ dune build
  $ dune utop
  $ dune exec lib/repl.exe
  $ dune runtest
  $ dune install
#+end_example

** Enjoy on someone else's machine

#+begin_example
  $ cd /path/to/your_project
  $ docker image build -t your/project .
  $ docker container run -it your/project
  $ docker container run -it your/project opam exec dune build
  $ docker container run -it your/project opam exec dune utop
  $ docker container run -it your/project opam exec dune exec lib/repl.exe
  $ docker container run -it your/project opam exec dune runtest

#+end_example

* Assumptions

=spinup='s defaults reflect the needs of the author's typical code
projects:

- library-executable design
- =dune= as a build tool
- =opam= as a package manager
- [[https://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/software/prelude/prelude/Prelude/][Prelude]] (with [[https://github.com/bufordrat/etude][Etude]]) as a standard library
- =alcotest= as a unit-testing framework
- cram tests powered by =dune=
- [[https://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/software/tint/lib/top/][TINT]] as a template engine
- =Dockerfile= for reproducible builds
- code formatting using =ocamlformat=, run automatically in a git
  pre-commit hook
